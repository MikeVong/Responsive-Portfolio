        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;My name is Quay Vong, my nickname is Mike. I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with bachelor of arts degree at 2005. I quickly got a job working for the Geek Squad at Best Buy the same year. I worked as an on site IT technician called Double Agent for 11 years. After word, I want to get out of retail. I worked for a charter school for 3 years as an IT technician again, and after that. I want to dive deeper into web developer , I want to have a change of career. And here I am.
